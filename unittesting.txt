A few problems that I ran into while unit testing: first, the makefile only manages to get 
the first unit test results into the output file. I know the other unit tests run fine, so
I'm not sure why this happens. Other than that, and a few other syntax issues, the unit testing
went smoothly. the drawcard() and compare() functions are not functioning properly at all,
and will need to be fixed as these are important pieces of many other card effects and functions,
