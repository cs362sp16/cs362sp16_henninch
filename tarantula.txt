I'm actually surprised with how well my implementation of tarantula works. While it only gives a really general block of code that is connected to a 
failing unit test, it does a good job of visualizing what parts of the code are involved in large numbers of bugs. one of the bugs that was pretty clear
was the bug involved in the adventurer card. It clearly demonstrates where the problem with the code is. overall, I think tarantula implementation was 
a success. 

P.S. - the tarantula.out file in the repository is the output of my tarantula implementation, but for some reason it doesn't display text when that
			text is printed to a file. not sure why. if it is just run normally it will color text based on severity though.
