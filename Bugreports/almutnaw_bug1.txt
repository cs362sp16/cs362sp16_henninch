SUMMARY:
	Adventurer card unit test doesn't test the effect of the adventurer card

SEVERITY: 
	moderate	

DETAILS:
	Due to how the adventurer card was refactored, the cardEffect function will always return 0 (which in the unit test for the card indicates that adventurer
	executed correctly), regardless of the effect of the adventurer card. the unit test needs to be changed to check the variables relevant to the adventurer
	card's effects, namely the gaining of two treasure cards into the players hand, and the incrementation of drawnTreasure by two.
