the random testing went much better than the unit testing, both in how I felt designing the tests, and in how the tests preformed.
the random testing tests each card 300 times with random deck sizes, players, and discard cards. the coverage and fault detection was
better than the unit testing, though whether that speaks to how effective the random tests are or to how poor my unit tests were is 
sort of up in the air.
