SUMMARY:
	Adventurer card will only loop until one treasure card has been drawn, not two (as the card should)

SEVERITY: 
	Critical	

DETAILS:
	the adventurer card function is occurs in a while loop: "while(drawntreasure<1){...." 
	the adventurer card should allow the player to draw two treasure cards and then exit,
	but with this loop it will only execute untill the player draws one treasure card. the 
	function can be easily fixed by changing "while(drawntreasure<1){.." to "while(drawntreasure<2){.."
